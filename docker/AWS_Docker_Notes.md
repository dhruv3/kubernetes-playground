## What is virtualization?
* Virtualization is the division of physical computer and networking resources into smaller, more flexible units, 
presenting these smaller units to users as though each was a discrete resource.

* As soon as your virtual server completes its task or becomes unnecessary, you can instantly delete it. 
This will free up the resources it was using for the next task in the queue.
* Containers like Docker, on the other hand, **aren’t standalone virtual machines** but are modified file systems 
sharing the operating system kernel of their physical host.

## Containers
* Containers are extremely lightweight virtual servers that, as you can see from the figure, rather 
than running as full operating systems, share the underlying kernel of their host OS.

* The script-friendly container design makes it easy to automate and remotely manage complex clusters of containers, 
often deployed as microservices.

## Docker
* Docker container is an image whose behavior is defined by a script.
* What is an image?
  * It’s a software file containing a snapshot of a full operating system file system.
  * An image might consist of just a base operating system like Ubuntu. 
  But an image could also include additional layers with software applications like web servers and databases. 
* An image is launched as a container, an extra writable layer is automatically added into which the record of 
any ongoing system activity is saved.
